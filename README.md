# MoodEx


## What is MoodEx?

Moodex incorporates step and active minute tracking algorithms. In addition, the application tracks the user’s daily mood and calorie intake, and, using this data, the user can monitor the correlation between his or her exercise, eating habits, and overall mood. In this project a Wellness App for Android devices is developed to track these factors.

## MoodEx’s Purpose

The purpose of MoodEx is to create a wellness application for the Android platform capable of tracking, recording, and displaying data relevant to a user’s activity, calorie, and mood habits. The overall goal is to show the user his or her daily habits and help them make choices that will result in a healthier lifestyle, and therefore, a happier life.

## Problems which Moodex will solve:

Making daily healthy choices is a challenge that every individual faces. These choices end up becoming daily habits that influence a person’s lifestyle. MoodEx will show the correlation between the user’s wellness choices and their mood. With this information, individuals will become aware of deficiencies in their everyday habits and will hopefully encourage the user to self-regulate towards improvement.

## How will MoodEx improve the wellness of users?

MoodEx will facilitate a new process for individuals developing a healthy, happy lifestyle. Research has shown that increased exercise activity has positive effects on a person’s overall mood. More specifically, when a person exercises, they are improving their physical appearance due to becoming more physically fit, so exercise has a direct influence on a person’s self esteem.
